anime-scripts
=============

A couple of scripts for hardsubbing anime and cutting several episodes together.

Dependencies
------------

* My dotfiles repo:
  * `ff-hardsub`
  * `ff-lossy-h264`
  * `ff-lossless-cut` if you're writing cuts.mk
* ffmpeg
* mkvmerge (mkvtoolnix-cli)
* dos2unix
* make

Requires a basic knowledge of Makefiles (variables, targets, order-only
prerequisites) and the linux command line.
